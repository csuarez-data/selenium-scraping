# selenium-scraping

Selenium built scraper for scraping product details and images for a skincare website. Built in 2 parts; part one scrapes product names and brands then inputs these back into the site to open product pages to mine product descriptions, images and ingredients.

Selenium is excellent for its customisation of clicks to navigate around tricky webpages. Code can be used to replicate scraping efforts for other product websites.
